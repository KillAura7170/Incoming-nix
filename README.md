# How Incoming Started:
Incoming started as a joke I (OP_Killaura) got the bowbomb beta code and I put it in oyvey and as a joke i renamed the client as Incoming. After some time client got leaked so I added more modules and it was doing well for a private client. After sometime it got leaked again so i made it a public client. Client will be updated and will resive support.

# Support
If u find any bugs or issues while using the client pls mag me on discord it is KillAura#7170. And BerryPGz he help fix the GUI and dum dum more stuff :D
